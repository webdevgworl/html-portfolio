<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Amelia. I carry 8+ years of Business Development experience in the SaaS Enterprise Technology space. I've worked across FinTech, MarTech, and enjoy the art of the possible when it comes to technology.</p>

<p>Web development has been a passion of mine, as I love to create things from scratch and learn new skillsets. My goal is to support small business owners from a technical perspective, and lend my skills to helping them scale operations.</p>

<p>In my freetime, you can find me outside hiking with my husband, walking my dog, paddle boarding, and doing yoga.</p>
